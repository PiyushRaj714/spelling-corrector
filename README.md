# spelling-corrector

This repository contains a Python script for a simple spelling corrector. It is designed to take a misspelled word as input and suggest possible corrections based on a provided dataset.

# How it works
The spelling corrector utilizes a technique known as edit distance to find the most likely correct word based on the input. It calculates the edit distance between the misspelled word and each word in the dataset, considering operations such as deletion, insertion, substitution, and transposition of characters. The suggested corrections are ranked based on their edit distance score.

# Getting Started
To use the spelling corrector, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
git clone https://github.com/PiyushRaj714/spelling-corrector.git
Make sure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.0 or higher).

Install the required dependencies. The script uses the editdistance library, which can be installed using pip:


pip install editdistance
Modify the provided dataset in the words.txt file or replace it with your own dataset. Each word should be on a separate line.

Run the spelling_corrector.py script, providing the misspelled word as input:


python spelling_corrector.py coreecrotr
The script will output the suggested corrections for the provided word.

# Customization
You can modify the script according to your needs. Some possible customizations include:

# Implementing additional algorithms or techniques for improved spelling correction.
Adding more datasets or using a different dataset for training.
Modifying the ranking or scoring mechanism for suggested corrections.
Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue in the repository.
